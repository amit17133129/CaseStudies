## What is Openshift ?

OpenShift is a family of containerization software products developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform — an on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Red Hat OpenShift 

is the hybrid cloud platform of open possibility: powerful, so you can build anything and flexible, so it works anywhere.
Red Hat OpenShift offers automated `installation`, `upgrades`, and `lifecycle management` throughout the container stack—the `operating system`, `Kubernetes` and `cluster services`, and `applications—on any cloud`.

Red Hat OpenShift helps teams build with `speed`, `agility`, `confidence`, and `choice`. Code in production mode anywhere you choose to build. Get back to doing work that matters.

## Challenge : -
Ford Motor Company seeks to provide mobility solutions at accessible prices to its customers, including dealerships and parts distributors who sell to a variety of retail and commercial consumers.

## Solution : -
To speed delivery and simplify maintenance, the company sought to create a container-based application platform to modernize its legacy stateful applications and optimize its hardware use.

With this platform, based on RedHat OpenShift and supported by Red Hat and Sysdig technology, Ford has improved developer productivity, enhanced its security and compliance approach, and optimized its hardware use to improve operating costs.
Now, the company can focus on exploring new ways to innovate, from big data to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Benefits : -
1. Improved productivity with standardized development environment and self-service provisioning
2. Enhanced security with enterprise technology from Red Hat and continuous monitoring provided by Sysdig
3. Significantly reduced hardware costs by running OpenShift on bare metal.

## Features of OpenShift
OpenShift has come a long way since the release of its first version, and it can now offer a large array of benefits and exciting features. Here are five features you should know about:
### Web console: 
To make application development and deployment as simple as possible, OpenShift includes a web-based developer interface with a responsive user interface design. This interface can be accessed from any modern web browser and used to effortlessly manage applications and related resources.

### Command-line tools: 
In addition to the web-based developer interface, OpenShift also provides a set of command-line tools. These tools are available and you can download them directly from the web interface. These tools can be used to create and manage OpenShift applications and projects from a terminal. Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported, and a step-by-step tutorial for each platform is available online.
### IDE support: 
In the spirit of open-source software, OpenShift strives to give developers as much freedom to choose their workflow as possible, integrating with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and JBoss Developer Studio.

### Application templates: 
Included in OpenShift are pre-created quick start application templates, whose purpose is to allow developers to get started with a simple click, regardless of whether they wish to develop an application using Java, Python, PHP, or any other language.

### Continuous integration: 
Also known simply as CI, continuous integration is all about frequent merging of code changes into a central repository, and OpenShift makes it easy because it includes Jenkins, the leading open source automation server. Jenkins is easy to set up, and it supports hundreds of plugins and third-party integrations.
