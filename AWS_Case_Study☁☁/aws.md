## WHAT IS AWS ?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.

In simple words AWS allows you to do the following things-

1. Running web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites.
2. Securely store all your files on the cloud so you can access them from anywhere.
3. Using managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server to store information.
4. Deliver static and dynamic files quickly around the world using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
5. Send bulk email to your customers.

Airbnb is an American home rental platform based in San Francisco that lets people list, find, and rent short-term lodging in 65,000 cities and more than 191 countries across the globe. Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, it has done more than any other company to change the way people find places to stay away from home. Airbnb offers arrangement for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commission from each booking.

Airbnb, an abbreviation for "air mattress B&B," has a fairly simple structure on the outside. 

Hosts can use the site to rent out extra spaces in their house or apartment to travelers - typically for much cheaper than hotel lodgings. And, with Airbnb's presence in over 81,000 cities and 192 worldwide countries, if you have internet access, you can pretty much use the service anywhere.

## How Airbnb was Started?
A history of Airbnb summed up in a brief. Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk started Airbnb when they couldn’t afford the rent of their flat. The rent of the room increased by 25 percent and that’s when Nathan decided he would leave the room. They built the site and advertise about it in the local newspaper, from which they got three customers. Brian and Joe attended the conference with the customers and also showed them the city. They got around $1500 dollar which was enough to pay their rent.
