## What is Jenkins ❓
Jenkins is an open-source tool build in java for continuous integration purposes. Jenkins manages and automates the complete lifecycle of the software development lifecycle including build, test, package, deployment, and much more.
We can configure Jenkins to watch for any change in the code on GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and then automate the complete build process with help of tools like Maven and Gradel also we can integrate Jenkins with containers tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
With Jenkins, any organization can accelerate the software development process through automation. With the help of plugins, Jenkins can be integrated with almost all the tools.

## Introduction to Jenkins
Continuous Integration is the most important part of DevOps that is used to integrate various DevOps stages. Jenkins is the most famous Continuous Integration tool, I know you are curious to know the reason behind the popularity of Jenkins, and if Jenkins is easy to learn.

## What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration is a development practice in which the developers are required to commit changes to the source code in a shared repository several times a day or more frequently. Every commit made in the repository is then built. This allows the teams to detect the problems early. Apart from this, depending on the Continuous Integration tool, there are several other functions like deploying the build application on the test server, providing the concerned teams with the build and test results, etc.


## Continuous Integration With Jenkins
Let us imagine a scenario where the complete source code of the application was built and then deployed on test server for testing. It sounds like a perfect way to develop software, but, this process has many flaws.
Developers have to wait until the complete software is developed for the test results.
There is a high possibility that the test results might show multiple bugs. It was tough for developers to locate those bugs because they have to check the entire source code of the application.
It slows the software delivery process.
Continuous feedback pertaining to things like coding or architectural issues, build failures, test status and file release uploads was missing due to which the quality of software can go down.
The whole process was manual which increases the risk of frequent failure.
It is evident from the above-stated problems that not only the software delivery process became slow but the quality of software also went down. This leads to customer dissatisfaction. So to overcome such chaos there was a dire need for a system to exist where developers can continuously trigger a build and test for every change made in the source code. This is what CI is all about. Jenkins is the most mature CI tool available.

## Advantages of Jenkins
1. It is open source and it is user-friendly, easy to install and does not require additional installations or components.
2. It is open source tool.
3. Easily Configurable. Jenkins can be easily modified and extended. It deploys code instantly, generates test reports. Jenkins can be configured according to the requirements for    continuous integrations and continuous delivery.
4. Platform Independent. Jenkins is available for all platforms and different operating systems, whether OS X, Windows or Linux.
5. Rich Plugin ecosystem. The extensive pool of plugins makes Jenkins flexible and allows building, deploying and automating across various platforms.
6. Easy support. Because it is open source and widely used, there is no shortage of support from large online communities of agile teams.
7. Developers write the tests to detect the errors of their code as soon as possible. So the developers don’t waste time on large-scale error-ridden integrations.
8. Issues are detected and resolved almost right away which keeps the software in a state where it can be released at any time safely.
9. Most of the integration work is automated. Hence fewer integration issues. This saves both time and money over the lifespan of a project.


## ➰ Real-world case study of Continuous Integration
I am sure all of you aware of old phone Nokia. Nokia used to implement a procedure called nightly build. After multiple commits from diverse developers during the day, the software built every night. Since the software was built only once in a day, it's a huge pain to isolate, identify, and fix the errors in a large code base.

Later, they adopted Continuous Integration approach. The software was built and tested as soon as a developer committed code. If any error is detected, the respective developer can quickly fix the defect.
